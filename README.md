# PCB Business Card with QR and NFC

Please find here an attempt at designing a printed circuit board (PCD) business card using [KiCad 5.0](https://www.kicad.org/). The KiCad files and gerber files are included for reuse. This is *not* my original labor, and was derived directly from [https://github.com/anthonykouttron/pcb-business-card-qr-nfc](https://github.com/anthonykouttron/pcb-business-card-qr-nfc).

All praise and credit is exclusively owed to the fantastic Anthony Kouttron and Brian D. Carlton, for creating awesome KiCad business card designs. This project is derived from Anthony's extension of Brian's original project, and was released using the <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.<br />
